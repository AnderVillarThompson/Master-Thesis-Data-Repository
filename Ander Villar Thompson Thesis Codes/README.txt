The code used for this thesis is in the "Codes" folder. DO NOT move the .do file from this folder, as doing so will break down its functionality. Please read the instructions at the start of the .do file, as it requires user input for proper function. Furthermore, you must replace the section that says: cd "ROOT DIRECTORY" with the directory that this .txt file is in, assuming the reader has not altered the structure of this data tree already. If you have done so, please redownload this series of files.
